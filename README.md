# MVC-Tech-Blog

## Description
This app is a blog where users can interact within themselves by posting about anything they'd like and also leave comments. Express.js was used for the server and MySQL for the database along with Sequelize as the ORM to run SQL models and queries.
The SQL database includes tables for user, post,  and comment. RESTful API routes are used to make requests and updates from the database which are joined through Sequelize queries.
